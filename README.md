# Color-detector-using-OpenCV
A Python-OpenCV project that detects and identifies the color of any object in real time via a camera. It tracks a selected point or region, reads pixel BGR/HSV values, and displays the exact color name, enabling fast and accurate color recognition for design, robotics, and accessibility use.
